##Maths in C++

This repo will contain code solving the Numerical problems given in https://github.com/karan/Projects. 

Currently, the Fibonnaci and Prime Factorizer problems have been solved and I am working on successfully implementing the chudnovsky algorithm for finding the value of pi upto n digits

Code is standard STL C++ 2011. Boost is not used and I have no plans to use it in the the Future.
